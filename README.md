Rocketmiles Cash Register Project
To compile and run unit tests execute the following command (in Unix/Linux/Mac add ./ before the command):
gradlew build

To build Eclipse workspace for the project execute the following command:
gradlew eclipse

If you are behind a firewall, you will need to have Gradle installed locally. Once installed, 
replace "gradlew" with "gradle" in the commands above.

Thank you for reviewing my project.
